**Confirmed Features:**
~USA will be able to reclaim lots of it's lost allied land (such as UK, AUS, etc) through events on historical mode similar to how germany begins to take lots of land in vanilla hoi4, if any war happens before certain events happen losses will be massive on both sides

~Other nations able to be freed/liberated through various methods (African Union, Asianic Alliance, Brazilian Reich, Cuba, China, People's Republic of China, and much more)

~Surrender Feature (will be made into separate mod as well as I do not agree with the Offer Peace System)

~Every country has history and purpose behind it's annexation and will be explain further into development and upon further release (Philippines was a USA puppet, but is under USSR control for a reason. Cuba was communist, but is under USA control for a reason)

~Diverse Choice-Based Events (Allows players back and fourth choices, resulting in many different outcomes making every play-through unique as possible)

~Mixed Ideologies due to both USA & USSR population and Annexed population not agreeing with the annexation war causing instability in both countries

~USA & USSR will have extended timelines meaning that the focus trees will have nearly 200 focuses, allowing a diverse range of choices

~Historical mode will follow a set written story-line with national focuses and non-historical will involve more diverse events happening such as Africa becoming free from USSR, China breaking free from USSR, Cuba breaking free from USA and much more)

~A detailed timeline on World War 3 which happened shortly after World War 2 was ended known as "The Great Annexation War" There will be a detailed history about this war, though it was brief (ended in less than a year) and did not involve any American or Soviet forces in combat with each other at any point in time

~Economic Issues for both USA & USSR due to population from annexed countries rebelling and many of the national people of USA & USSR disagreeing with 'The Great Annexation War'

~Both USA & USSR have unique major limitations and mechanics that will make each country interesting (example: USA was apart of NATO which did follow the conventional warfare rules before 'The Great Annexation War' but the USSR does not follow these rules and therefore can use ABC warfare straight away, whereas USA has to unlock this through political focuses and events)

~Upon completion of Verge of Domination, there will be various seperate versions which will feature other hand-crafted alternate histories with all the same features as Verge of Domination featuring different takes on history such as Japan vs USA, Brazil vs USA, China vs USSR, and lots more

~Every nation that appears in the mod will have a unique focus tree with many immersive choices

~Thousands of custom-made events all dedicated to creating a detailed alternate history

~Expanded Units, Tanks, Planes, Submarines, Ships, Chemical Weapons, Nukes, Special Vehicles, etc

~Anti-American & Anti-Soviet uprisings

~ABC Warfare (ability to research and add Atomic, Biological and Chemical tactics to divisions)
