        vod_soviet_events.1.t: "Status of the USSR"
        vod_soviet_events.1.d: "Now the largest landmass on the face of the planet in late spring of June 1945, the Soviet Union refused to allow any form of elections in Poland, and Czechoslovakia, near the borders of Frankfurt on the 6th of June, Soviet and Allied troops engage in a firefight under the command of U.S. General Patton. Fifteen Red guard troops are killed and a dozen wounded, three  US rangers and five British Riflemen are killed and Twenty-Five are  wounded. The Allied local outpost was set ablaze. Marshal Zukov is furious when he recieves the report on the incident, less than 3 hours later Stalin himself is contacted Stalin demands the men deemed envolved in the incident be tried and punished including Patton himself. Truman in a vain attempt wants to have Patton brought to a firing squad however its too late the next morning full fledged assault and artillary from hell rained across the ceasefire line in Germany. Europe becomes plagued with war for another year, the damage done to Europe is far worse then,the Six years of World war II. Within a month the Soviets are knocking onto the gates of Paris as a stray Artillary shell struck the Effiel Tower splitting it in half it is unkown who fired the shell. Weeks later Spain joins the Allies however within another month the Allies are knocked out of Europe entirely, currently not is well in the USSR resistance movements are heavy and one spark may be only needed to mark a collapse of the USSR. Comrade Stalin is under heavy security detail at all times due to paranoia of being assainated."
